## Should 

- prevent time running faster in some cases (??)
- game end transition missing, there needs to be something
- show score after game
- communicate that you can use keys
- bug: absolutely breaks when there is "nothing to practice"
- game breaks if you have nothing left to train
	- also this feels like intervals get insane, not sure if reasonable..


## Could 

- reimplement supabase or simple anonymous data logging anyways
- replace sentence dataset with something less crap
