### General

#### [[SR]]

- here I opted for always showing two possible answers for the [[Cloze Deletion]], one right, one wrong
    - ...and the wrong one was selected to have small string distance to the correct one
	    - → [[~ if you force interfering learning items into context, does that help encoding﹖]]

### Lessons Learned

- this one automatically goes to the next item after a while (*or* when pressing `Show Next`)
	- I think this is based on feedback for [[Map Practice]]
- [[supabase is -ok- regarding setup complexity, but still feels overkill for simple SR data-logging]]
